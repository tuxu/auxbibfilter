auxbibfilter
============

This is a small commandline tool to filter records from a BibTeX database that
match the citekeys used in a LaTeX document.

This is especially useful if all your references are stored in a big
BibTeX file and you want to create a reduced set of entries, e.g. for the
submission to a journal. I use it to create a subset from files generated by
[Papers](http://www.mekentosj.com/papers/).

The program parses `\citation` lines in the `aux` file created by
a LaTeX run to build a list of used citekeys, and only those records from
the database `bib` file are written to the output.

Note that the BibTeX parser is incredibly dumb and based *entirely* on a regular
expression that matches records looking like

    @type{citekey,
    ...
    }
